1) Why do you need to allocate new dynamic memory when you increase the size of an existing array of dynamically allocated memory?
Ans. Because we have to add another data in the exiting array and the previously allocated memory not enough for new data that is why.  

2) The Kingdom structure stores the name of the kingdom in an array of characters. At the end of the program, We do not use the delete operator to deal-locate the memory occupied by the name. Why don’t we need to use the delete operator on this array itself? Explain.
Ans. Because when program is closed, allocated memory will erased automatically we do not need to delete it.

3) There are two display(...) function definitions. How does the compiler know which definition to call from your main function?
Ans. there are two display functions but they have different number of arguments and when user enter input compiler will know which function should be called. 

4) Explain what have you have learned in this workshop.
Ans. I learnt two things from this workshop first is dynamic memory allocation and the second one is function overloading.
