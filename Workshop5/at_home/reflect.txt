1. The operator + returns a Fraction object. Explain why this operator should not return a reference to a Fraction object.
Ans. if we pass reference to object it would go through the constructor then it impossible to call reduce function because of reduce function call in constructor.  

2. List the temporary objects in the tester module.
Ans. a and c are the temporary object because their put into safe state at the end.

3. List the simplifications that you made to your class to minimize duplication.
Ans. I  minimize the redundancy of code by using isEmpty() function in other functions.

4. Explain what you have learned in this workshop.
Ans. I learnt from this workshop how to overload an operator as a member function and access current object within member function.
